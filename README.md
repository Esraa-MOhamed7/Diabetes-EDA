# 🩺 Diabetes Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores diabetes patient data to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential risk factors.  
By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to transform raw medical data into actionable insights for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment improvement.


## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbatra1210/diabetes-dataset) *(Replace with actual dataset link)*
- **Description:** Contains patient information including age, gender, genetic & family history, insulin levels, blood pressure, and type of diabetes.


## 📊 Key Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Distribution of Type of Diabetes by Genetic and Family Risk

**Insight:**  
Patients with a positive family history have a significantly higher proportion of Type 2 Diabetes compared to those without a family risk.


### 2️⃣ Distribution of Insulin Levels for Each Type of Diabetes

**Insight:**  
Type 2 Diabetes patients tend to have higher insulin levels on average, while Type 1 patients show more variability.


### 3️⃣ Relationship Between Insulin and Blood Pressure
![Insulin vs Blood Pressure](images/insulin_vs_bp.png)  
**Insight:**  
A moderate positive correlation exists between insulin levels and blood pressure — higher insulin is often associated with elevated blood pressure.


## 🔍 Insights
- Family history is a strong risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes.
- Type 2 patients generally exhibit higher insulin levels than Type 1.
- Elevated insulin levels may contribute to increased blood pressure, indicating possible cardiovascular risk.


## ✅ Recommendations
- Increase screening for individuals with a family history of diabetes.
- Monitor insulin and blood pressure together to catch early signs of metabolic syndrome.
- Target lifestyle interventions for high-risk patients to reduce both insulin resistance and hypertension.
